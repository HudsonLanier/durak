<h3>Trump</h3>
    <p>
        Trump is decided at the beginning of the game. 
        The first card popped out of the deck decides the trump suit.
        A trump card can be used to break any non-trump card, or
        to break a lower trump card. Trump cards can only be broken
        by higher trump cards.

<h2>Cheating</h2>
<h3>Stealing the trump card</h3>
    <p>
        You can replace the trump card by one of the cards
        in your hand. This doesn't change the trump but you
        get the trump card to play with as a regular card.

<h3>Throwing wrong cards</h3>
